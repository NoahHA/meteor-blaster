# Meteor Blaster

Meteor Blaster is a 2D space shooter written in pygame. I created this project to teach myself pygame and the basics of game development. The game is inspired by old arcade shooters and the idea of the game is that you control a spaceship that's flying through a meteor shower. The object of the game is to destroy the meteors before they reach the bottom of the screen and to avoid being hit by them. Players also have the option to save and load games using a SQL database and at the end of the game are prompted to enter their name so it can be displayed in a leaderboard.
